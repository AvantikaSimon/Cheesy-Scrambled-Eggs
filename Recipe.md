Step 1
Take the bowl and eggs, then crack the eggs into the bowl. Make sure to take out any stray bits of eggshell that might have fallen into the bowl with a spoon.

Step 2
Whisk your eggs until the whites and yolk are mixed well. Add the milk, and whisk until it is all thoroughly mixed. Add salt and pepper, depending on how much you want, amd mix again.

Step 3 
Put the pan on the stove, and heat it up. Pour the egg mixture into the pan slowly. Take the spatula and stir the mixture, so that it doesn't stick to the pan. Once the mixture is still liquidy, but hot, add the cheese. Sprinkling it all around helps to get cheese everywhere, and not in clumps.

Step 4
Stir the mixture occasionally, to make sure that nothing sticks to the bottom or sides. Once it has formed into clumps of fluffy egg, stop the flame and take the pan off the stove. 

Step 5
Use the spatula, and take the scrambled eggs out of the pan, either into a bowl or directly into a plate. Serve warm and cheesy. Happy eating!
